# play-statistical-projects
This is a collection of jupyter projects messing around with some cool ideas in probability and statistics, analysis type things mostly in R, etc. 
A sandbox for playing with different statistical models, data sets, and techniques. This repo is part of my personal learning journey and includes small experiments, mini-projects, and half-baked ideas I’m trying to understand better.

## Current Contents

Some things I might be exploring:
- Regression experiments
- Visualization techniques
- Distributions and simulations
- Probability-based models

## Why This Exists

I wanted a place to freely explore stats topics without the pressure of perfection. Some of these might become full projects later—right now, it’s just learning through tinkering.

## Notes

- Expect messy notebooks and in-progress code
- Things may change or move around
- All feedback welcome!
